        <h1>Mauricio Eric Castillejo</h1>
        <h2>College Student just getting by and waiting for their Bachelor Degree</h2>
        <p>I'm Mauricio, I am a senior student from California State Northridge majoring Computer Science. After this Summer Session, I would meet all requirements for my Baccalaureate Degree. I learned computer coding around the end of high school. I hope to make some small projects that can help enforce the knowledge of coding and hopefully apply those skills in the work field.<br><br>
      I have moderate experience with Java, and plan to bolster my knowledge even after I graduate. I am also learning Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript. A framework I recently worked on React and it&apos;s extension React-Native for a senior design project, which I plan to learn more about in the future.
